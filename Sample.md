## Deduplicating-Cloud-functions 

Deduplication is useful for organizations dealing with highly redundant operations that requires constant copying and storing of data for future reference or recovery purpose. 

The term is explained as an approach that eliminates duplicate copies of data from the system. For instance, a file that is backed up every week results in a lot of duplicate data and thus, eats up considerable disk space. Deduplication run an analysis and eliminates these sets of duplicate data and keeps only what is unique and essential, thus significantly clearing storage space. Here are some benefits of data deduplication for organizations.

  * Clears storage space: Running the technique can help reduce storage requirements by up to 80% for backups and files. This allows         organizations save far more data on the same system and extends disk purchase intervals automatically. With the advantage of speed,     organizations can store data to disk cost effectively.

  * Adept replication: The deduplication process writes only unique data on the disk and thus, there’s need to replicate only these set     of blocks. Depending on the type of application, the traffic for data replication can be reduced by 90%.

  * Effective use of network bandwidth: If data deduplication takes place at sources, there’s no need to transmit data over the network,     thus eliminating unwanted use of network bandwidth.

  * Cost-effective: As fewer disks are required, storage cost is reduced significantly. Besides, it also tends to improve disaster           recovery as lesser amount of data is transferred.

With the massive data explosion, technologies that offers approaches to efficiently manage it is considered real attractive.Deduplication is one such technology that assist with effectively managing storage devices as it enables efficient usage of data storage and network bandwidth.

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a novel storage de-duplication framework for serverless platform in order to improve overall throughput of the platform.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

The final product of this project will be a de-duplication service that leverages application-aware semantic-equivalence to identify duplicate data at storage system and avoids redundant invocation of functions on servers. Main goals include:

  * Define and implement specialized data curation techniques
  * Optimize de-duplication data structure and indexing
  * Perform data and event de-duplication to avoid redundant execution of stateless functions
  
The vision section describes the final desired state of the project once the project is complete. It also specifies the key goals of the project. This section provides a context for decision-making. A shared vision among all team members can help ensuring that the solution meets the intended goals. A solid vision clarifies perspective and facilitates decision-making.


## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

**It does not target:**

   * MOC admin users, who will work against the command line.
   * Administrators of cloud services, who will continue to use the services of serverless functions.

**It targets:**

   * Cloud vendors who design their serverless build environement. This will execute stateless functions without worrying internal            details as it saves them money by saving the functions calls in an instance.
   * Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is another very good candidate for deduplication, because the duplicate data among desktops is      very high

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

**What will be delivered?**

* Presents a faster framework for cloud providers: 

  * For providers who mostly deal with data generated from external end-points like IoT devices, cloud systems monitors, weather sensors, social media, mobile devices, etc

  * By avoiding container startup latency: Since most platforms execute stateless functions inside containers, eliminating redundant activation of functions results in low latency.

*  Presents a framework for improving “performance/cost” for end-users: 

    * End-users will use this framework indirectly which will, in turn, decrease the application cost for them since this framework increases throughput.

    * Availability to improve throughput by offering the user to define PoVs: PoVs(Point of Variability) are parts of the data that is not important for the execution and should be ignored such as metadata. Availability of letting the user choose those points allows a more fine-grained de-duplication.

* Scalability: This novel storage de-duplication framework is designed and will be implemented for serverless execution model which in principle is flexible regarding scaling. An application can be scaled automatically or by adjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption.

* Security: Security can be ensured by writing secure application code and tight access control over source code. 

**What will not be delivered?**

* This framework does not help save storage space since for every new data coming original data is stored multiple times.

* This system can only be implemented on storage closed-loop functions, which takes data from data storage and writes the result again to the data storage. However, external stimuli functions are not the part of this de-duplication design because they take their data from storage but then trigger external events.

## 4. Solution Concept

This section provides a high-level outline of the solution.


Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:

Our objective for the project is to demonstrate the efficiency in performing function deduplication by deduplicating data. Ideally, we would implement such deduplication inside existing open serverless framework like OpenWhisk, but given time constraint we will implement a POC, where we will build these dedup components *on-top of* OpenWhisk instead of inside OpenWhisk. So essentially, users now will interact with our layer instead of interacting with OpenWhisk directly.

 1. Users will register their data sources (IoT, System logs, etc.) to our service (sanity)
 2. Users will register their functions that they want to execute for their data events
 3. Sanity controller components
    * **Cloud Object Store** : We will use minio which is open source
    * **Message/Event Buffer**: We will use kafka
    * **Deduplication controller**: We will maintain data dedup index
    * **Function controller**: That decides whether data if unique and needs to be invoked on OpenWhisk or it is duplicate and we can           avoid invoking it

Design Implications and Discussion:

The picture shows the overall architecture for Sanity System. 
![alt text](https://github.com/bu-528-sp19/Deduplicating-Cloud-functions/blob/master/arch.PNG)
* **Data Storage** has the actual data from the multiple live running containers without any annotations or filtering.
* **Data Curation** filters each data event using either POV/filter based duplication. Then, it checks the checksum for each incoming data.
* **Sanity Controller** indexes each event into the hashmap which identifies if the event is duplicate for a function. If the event is duplicate, it gets the output reference for the result from the earlier invocation.
* **Function Rule Map** stores the rules to associate data events with respective functions.
* **Function dupMap** maintains checksum of all unique input data processed by each function 

## 5. Acceptance criteria

Minimum acceptance criteria is to prevent data duplication which in turn would prevent event duplication. 

The stretch goals are:

  * Integrate and contribute our code to OpenWhisk
  * Write a paper on this work for international conferences/workshops
